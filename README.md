# DbD-Randomizer
A simple loadout randomizer for the game "Dead by Daylight".

## Description
The "Update" and "Rarity Icons" scripts scrape data from the Dead by Daylight wiki, and "GUI" script runs the randomizer application.

## How to use
1. Run the "Update" script and wait for it to finish.
2. Run the "GUI" script.

### Note
As for now, only the killer side of the project is fully functional. This project is still a work in progress (with some errors here and there).
